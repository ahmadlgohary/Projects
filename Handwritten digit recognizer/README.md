Constructed a convolutional neural network with multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.

Accurately classified handwritten digits from MNIST dataset, consisting of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images

Applied normalization and reshaping to preprocess the images for feeding into the neural network.

Trained the model using stochastic gradient descent with adaptive estimation of first and second-order moments.

Designed an interactive GUI to draw digits on canvas to take user input for recognition.

Achieved an accuracy of over 98% on the test dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of the model for digit recognition.
